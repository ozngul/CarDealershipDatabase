# Car Dealership Database

This project was created by Exadus and Ozan Gül as part of a database workshop. It contains SQL scripts to build and populate a simple car dealership database.

#📄 Description

## The database includes the following main components:

    Dealerships

    Vehicles

    Inventory (which dealership has which car)

    Sales Contracts

    Lease Contracts 

### It is designed to be re-runnable, meaning the script can drop and recreate the database without issues.
